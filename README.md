# Monads
C# library of basic monads (Maybe, Reader, State, IO) and accompanying demos

This is the monad library and demo code for my presentation to CoderCamp 
Hamilton][1] [S16E03 on March 9, 2016][2]. It is licensed under the MIT License and 
can be used under those terms.

The slide presentation itself will be publlished shortly under a separate 
project, as I wish to retain full copyright to it. I will amend this note 
once that is complete.

Enjoy!

Pieter Geerkens
